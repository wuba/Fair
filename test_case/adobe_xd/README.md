# XD to Flutter example

## Flutter Channel
This example was created with the `dev` channel of Flutter, in order to support desktop. Building with another channel may cause issues on some target platforms.


## About
This is a simple example for the "XD to Flutter" plugin for Adobe XD.

The `Campvibes.xd` file has already been exported for convenience. All files in `assets/images/` and `lib/` (except `main.dart`) were generated by the plugin.

The file demonstrates responsive layout with images, text, shadows, gradients, vector art, components, repeat grids, and prototype links.

## Fonts
Note that the font entries in the yaml are incomplete, and will generate warnings. This is to avoid distributing font files with this example.
